Installation
------------

In this directory there should be a ``INSTALL.rst`` that describes how to setup an environment for running these benchmarks.


Benchmarks
----------

1. Lennard-Jones: This benchmark represents a model Molecular Dynamics system, it typically reachs a strong scaling limit around 100 nodes.
2. FMM: A benchmark that implements a Fast Multipole method. This is an example of a electrostatic solver that uses a hierarchical grid structure. This benchmark has a hard strong scaling limit of 4096 MPI ranks.
3. KMC: A Kinetic Monte Carlo benchmark. This benchmark should scale very well as the ratio of computation to communication is high. This benchmark should be compute bound.

Output
------

Each run of a benchmark code should be performed in a separate directory. On completion of a run the codes will produce a json output file ``last_time.json`` that contains the keys:

``time_taken_per_step``
    The time taken per step of simulation, this is our observable of interest.

``num_omp_threads``
    Recorded for data collection quality of life.

``num_mpi_ranks``
    Recorded for data collection quality of life.

Examples
--------

Each benchmark directory contains a ``hello_world`` directory that contains an example launch script that can be used to warm the code generation cache for the actual run and serves as an example on how to launch each benchmark.
